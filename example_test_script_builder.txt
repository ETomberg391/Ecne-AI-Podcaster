As a quick test, you can:
1. run command:
bash orpheus_tts.sh (Fully setup)
2. run command: 
source "./host_venv/bin/activate"
3. run command:
python3 script_builder.py --llm-model gemini_flash --topic "What are te best most efficient ways to get Precise Reforges?" --report --guidance "Please include what are precise reforges, how to get, what might not be worth the effort,and a small section on what Journeyman reforges are." --reference-docs-folder research/Example_Docs_Folder --no-search --guest-breakup

This should then build a report and a podcast script within the archive folder, which the final podcast script file can hen be used with orpheus_tts.py script to build the podcast with.

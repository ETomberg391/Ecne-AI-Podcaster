As a quick test, you can:
1. run command:
bash orpheus_tts.sh (Fully setup)
2. run command: 
source "./host_venv/bin/activate"
3. run command:
python3 script_builder.py --llm-model gemini_flash --topic "What are the best most efficient ways to get Precise Reforges?" --report --guidance "Please include what are precise reforges, how to get, what might not be worth the effort,and a small section on what Journeyman reforges are." --reference-docs-folder research/Example_Docs_Folder --no-search

This should then build a report and a podcast script within the archive folder, which the final podcast script file can hen be used with orpheus_tts.py script to build the podcast with.

For an example of the audio, you would need to find the 

Example script though for the TTS:
python3 orpheus_tts.py --script archive/20250422_011447_What_are_the_best_most_efficient_ways_to_get_Precis/podcast_script_final.txt --host-voice leo --guest-voice tara --output podcast_Mabinogi_Reforges --dev --guest-breakup

NOTE: You would need to set the right folder archive with the timestamp you made it on.
